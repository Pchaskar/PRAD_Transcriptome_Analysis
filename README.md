# GSE224644: Transcriptome-Wide Expression Analysis in Advanced Prostate Cancer

ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository contains scripts and analyses based on the dataset GSE224644 from GEO, associated with the study:

Tumor transcriptome-wide expression classifiers predict treatment sensitivity in advanced prostate cancers
Davicioni et al., Veracyte, 2023

The project demonstrates how to preprocess and analyze Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST v2 microarray data using modern R-based pipelines for RMA normalization, annotation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

ðŸ§¬ Objectives
Normalize CEL files using RMA (Robust Multiarray Averaging)
Integrate phenotype data from GEO
Annotate probe IDs with gene symbols
Perform exploratory analyses including PCA and hierarchical clustering
Visualize transcriptomic variation across patient samples
